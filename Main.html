          <span class="title-project">ABOUT ME (2004)</span>
          <p>Twenty years ago I saw the first light of day. In my early days I spent most of my time playing video games with my brothers. Over the years I developed a questionably healthy interest and curiosity towards games and how they were made. I spent quite a lot of time in level editors and development journeys than playing the actual games. That curiosity turned me into what I am today, a creative professional yet still eager to learn more tricks of the trade.</p>
            <p>In 2025 I will receive my bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences with major in Game Development at the FAST University of Computer Sciences. I keep improving myself as the industry moves forward. During my studies, I have worked for a years as Jr.Game Programmer at a Islamabad game studio We.R.Play. In 2022 I joined Smarnovative Labs as Game Programmer & System Automator.</p>
            <p>During my journey along the way, I've gathered new insights and different perspectives. New engines, new tools, met new people, improved my scripting abilities. In my spare time I sometimes work on personal projects, varying from commercial projects to small hobby projects - either way I'm always learning.</p><img alt class="rsTmb" src="images/User Icon.png">

          <p>For this Call based communication system I used Unity Gaming Services (UGS) to create a Lobby, Voice Chat and Game Joining System. I used Vivox services to achieve these results. This system is built to add Voice & Text Chat in two clicks to Ludo Lush, our Online Game</p>

          </p>
          <p>I've designed over 50 level segments for Stage Rush: Imagine Dragons. It was also the first project where I contributed in 3D art and texturing, mostly in the form of props and obstacles. This made me less dependant on the art team who already had a busy time modeling the rest of the world and characters.</p>
